# Machine-Learning-Models
In This repository I made some simple to complex methods in machine learning. Here I try to build template style code. All of these models will be used on real datasets in another Jupyter notebook file with full documentation.

# Goal
I used more general form and some other methods for building templates to import them into a Jupyter notebook.
